# Processes and signals
## Processes
### What is a process?
A process is an instance of a program that is being executed. It contains the program code and its current activity. Depending on the operating system (OS), a process may be made up of multiple threads of execution that execute instructions concurrently.

A computer program is a collection of instructions that can be executed by a computer. A computer program is usually stored on disk and is loaded into memory when it is run. At that point, it becomes a process.

### What is a PID?
In a Unix-like operating system, a process ID (PID) is a number used by most operating system kernels—such as those of UNIX, macOS and Windows—to uniquely identify an active process. This number may be used as a parameter in various function calls allowing processes to be manipulated, such as adjusting the process's priority or killing it altogether.

### What is a signal?
Signals are a limited form of inter-process communication used in Unix, Unix-like, and other POSIX-compliant operating systems. A signal is an asynchronous notification sent to a process or to a specific thread within a process in order to notify it of an event that occurred.
