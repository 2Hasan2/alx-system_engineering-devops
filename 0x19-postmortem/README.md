# Postmortem: Service Interruption on ABC Platform

## Issue Summary

**<span style="color: #FF6347;">Duration:</span>**  
- **<span style="color: #4682B4;">Start:</span>** June 1, 2024, 08:00 AM (UTC)  
- **<span style="color: #4682B4;">End:</span>** June 1, 2024, 10:45 AM (UTC)  

**<span style="color: #FF6347;">Impact:</span>**  
- <span style="color: #6A5ACD;">The ABC platform experienced significant latency and occasional downtime.</span>
- <span style="color: #6A5ACD;">Approximately 85% of users reported issues accessing the service during this period.</span>
- <span style="color: #6A5ACD;">Businesses dependent on real-time transactions were the most affected.</span>

**<span style="color: #FF6347;">Root Cause:</span>**  
<span style="color: #6A5ACD;">A failure in the load balancer's automatic failover mechanism led to server overloads and intermittent service availability.</span>

## Root Cause and Resolution

**<span style="color: #FF6347;">Root Cause:</span>**  
- <span style="color: #6A5ACD;">A software bug in the load balancer's failover mechanism prevented automatic distribution of traffic.</span> 
- <span style="color: #6A5ACD;">This caused the primary servers to become overloaded, leading to service degradation.</span>

**<span style="color: #FF6347;">Resolution:</span>**  
- <span style="color: #6A5ACD;">Engineers manually redistributed the load across available servers.</span> 
- <span style="color: #6A5ACD;">The load balancer firmware was updated to fix the failover bug.</span> 
- <span style="color: #6A5ACD;">System performance was monitored to ensure the issue was fully resolved.</span>
